<h1 class="post-title">Overview</h1>
<h3 class="post-title">Using Kotlin for Server-side Development</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications, allowing you to write concise and
expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks
and a smooth learning curve:<br><br>

<b>Expressiveness:</b> Kotlin's innovative language features, such as its support for type-safe
builders and delegated properties, help build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions.<br><br>

<b>Scalability:</b> Kotlin's support for coroutines helps build server-side applications that scale to
massive numbers of clients with modest hardware requirements.<br><br>

<b>Interoperability:</b> Kotlin is fully compatible with all Java-based frameworks, which lets you stay
on your familiar technology stack while reaping the beneDts of a more modern language.<br><br>

<b>Migration:</b> Kotlin supports gradual, step by step migration of large codebases from Java to
Kotlin. You can start writing new code in Kotlin while keeping older parts of your system in
Java.<br><br>

<b>Tooling:</b> In addition to great IDE support in general, Kotlin oFers framework-speciDc tooling
(for example, for Spring) in the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.<br><br>

<b>Learning Curve:</b> For a Java developer, getting started with Kotlin is very easy. The automated
Java to Kotlin converter included in the Kotlin plugin helps with the Drst steps. Kotlin Koans
offer a guide through the key features of the language with a series of interactive exercises.

<h3 class="post-title">Frameworks for Server-side Development with Kotlin</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Spring makes use of Kotlin's language features to oFer more concise APIs, starting with
version 5.0. The online project generator allows you to quickly generate a new project in
Kotlin.<br><br>

Vert.x, a framework for building reactive Web applications on the JVM, oFers dedicated
support for Kotlin, including full documentation.<br><br>

Ktor is a framework built by JetBrains for creating Web applications in Kotlin, making use of
coroutines for high scalability and oFering an easy-to-use and idiomatic API.<br><br>

kotlinx.html is a DSL that can be used to build HTML in a Web application. It serves as an
alternative to traditional templating systems such as JSP and FreeMarker.<br><br>

Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable
microservice and serverless applications. It comes with a lot of built-in, handy features.<br><br>

Javalin is a very lightweight web framework for Kotlin and Java which supports WebSockets,
HTTP2 and async requests.<br><br>

The available options for persistence include direct JDBC access, JPA, as well as using NoSQL
databases through their Java drivers. For JPA, the kotlin-jpa compiler plugin adapts Kotlincompiled 
classes to the requirements of the framework.<br><br>

<h3 class="post-title">Using Kotlin for Android Development</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Android mobile development has been Kotlin-Drst since Google I/O in 2019.
Using Kotlin for Android development, you can beneDt from:<br><br>

<b>Less code combined with greater readability.</b> Spend less time writing your code and
working to understand the code of others.<br><br>

<b>Mature language and environment.</b> Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has developed
continuously, not only as a language but as a whole ecosystem with robust tooling. Now it's
seamlessly integrated in Android Studio and is actively used by many companies for
developing Android applications.<br><br>

<b>Kotlin support in Android Jetpack and other libraries.</b> KTX extensions add Kotlin language
features, such as coroutines, extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters, to existing
Android libraries.<br><br>

<b>Interoperability with Java.</b> You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming language in
your applications without needing to migrate all your code to Kotlin.<br><br>

<b>Support for multiplatform development.</b> You can use Kotlin for developing not only
Android but also iOS, backend, and web applications. Enjoy the beneDts of sharing the
common code among the platforms.<br><br>

<b>Code safety.</b> Less code and better readability lead to fewer errors. The Kotlin compiler
detects these remaining errors, making the code safe.<br><br>

<b>Easy learning.</b> Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.<br><br>

<b>Big community.</b> Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, which
is growing all over the world. According to Google, over 60% of the top 1000 apps on the Play
Store use Kotlin.

<h3 class="post-title">Kotlin JavaScript Overview</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Kotlin provides the ability to target JavaScript. It does so by transpiling Kotlin to JavaScript. The
current implementation targets ECMAScript 5.1 but there are plans to eventually target
ECMAScript 2015 as well.<br>

When you choose the JavaScript target, any Kotlin code that is part of the project as well as the
standard library that ships with Kotlin is transpiled to JavaScript. However, this excludes the JDK
and any JVM or Java framework or library used. Any Dle that is not Kotlin will be ignored during
compilation.<br>

The Kotlin compiler tries to comply with the following goals:<br><br>

Provide output that is optimal in size<br><br>

Provide output that is readable JavaScript<br><br>

Provide interoperability with existing module systems<br><br>

Provide the same functionality in the standard library whether targeting JavaScript or the JVM
(to the largest possible degree).

<h3 class="post-title">How it can be used</h3>
<div class="post-content">
You may want to compile Kotlin to JavaScript in the following scenarios:<br><br>

Creating Kotlin code that targets client-side JavaScript<br><br>

<b>Interacting with DOM elements.</b> Kotlin provides a series of statically typed interfaces to
interact with the Document Object Model, allowing creation and update of DOM elements.<br><br>

<b>Interacting with graphics such as WebGL.</b> You can use Kotlin to create graphical
elements on a web page using WebGL.<br><br>

Creating Kotlin code that targets server-side JavaScript<br><br>

<b>Working with server-side technology.</b> You can use Kotlin to interact with server-side
JavaScript such as Node.js<br><br>

Kotlin can be used together with existing third-party libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery or
React. To access third-party frameworks with a strongly-typed API, you can convert TypeScript
deDnitions from the DeDnitely Typed type deDnitions repository to Kotlin using the dukat tool.
Alternatively, you can use the dynamic type to access any framework without strong typing.<br><br>

JetBrains develops and maintains several tools speciDcally for the React community: React
bindings as well as Create React Kotlin App. The latter helps you start building React apps with
Kotlin with no build conDguration.<br><br>

Kotlin is compatible with CommonJS, AMD and UMD, making interaction with diFerent module
systems straightforward.
